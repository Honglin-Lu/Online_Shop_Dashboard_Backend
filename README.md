It's a simple online shop dashboard backend api. It includes the following modules: employees, customers, products, suppliers, orders, articles, banners, feedback and authentication. The main task is manipulating CRUD of these modules.
I build this api with ***Laravel Framework***. And I choose ***MySql*** for my database, as well, I use ***postman*** to test the api.
